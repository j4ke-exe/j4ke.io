<h2><p>Hey there — I'm Jake.</p></h2>

<p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am currently pursuing a Master’s in Cybersecurity (Information Security) at Georgia Tech. I'm passionate about cybersecurity — especially offensive security — and enjoy CTFs, exploit development, and low-level hacking. I built this blog to document my journey, share technical walkthroughs, and hopefully help others trying to break into the InfoSec world.</p>

<p>Most of my free time is spent researching vulnerabilities, reverse engineering binaries, or sharpening my skills on platforms like TryHackMe, Boot.dev, and Codecademy.</p>

<h3>Why This Blog?</h3>
<p>
I started this blog as a way to make sense of everything I'm learning on the path to becoming a professional penetration tester. It's a place to document the wins, the roadblocks, the half-working exploits, and the tools I keep reaching for. If you're also learning, struggling, or just curious — I hope you find something here that helps or inspires you.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t just a portfolio — it’s a work in progress, like me. I’ll be sharing notes, walkthroughs, ideas, and probably a few rants along the way. Come back anytime. You’re always welcome here.
</p><br> 

<p>Happy hacking.
