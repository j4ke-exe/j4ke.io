Welcome to my site, [j4ke.io](https://j4ke.io)! I blog about InfoSec, CTFs, and low-level systems programming. It’s built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and serves as both a portfolio and a living notebook for my journey through cybersecurity engineering.

## OMSCY at Georgia Tech

I'm currently pursuing the **Online Master of Science in Cybersecurity (InfoSec track)** at **Georgia Tech**.  
This site will feature detailed notes, projects, and writeups as I work through the OMSCY curriculum — including:

- Applied Cryptography & Network Security  
- Secure Software Design  
- Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering  
- Cyber-Physical Systems & Critical Infrastructure Defense  

If you're interested in GT OMSCY or self-studying cybersecurity, this site will document every step.
